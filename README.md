# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug with Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose comparison (==) when dealing with null values.  The `bug.js` file contains code illustrating the problem, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected version using strict equality (===).

## Problem

Loose comparison in JavaScript can lead to unexpected behavior.  Specifically, `null == 0` evaluates to true, which can cause issues when you're expecting to explicitly check for null. The original code attempts to handle null values but falls short due to this loose comparison.

## Solution

The solution utilizes strict equality (===) to ensure that only null values are specifically identified.  Strict equality does not perform type coercion, leading to more reliable comparisons.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your favorite code editor.
3. Run the JavaScript files using your preferred environment (e.g., Node.js, browser console).
4. Observe the differences in output between the original buggy code and the corrected version.
